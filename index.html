<h1> Gun Safety Advocates, Educators Call on Congress – Again – to Take Up Gun Legislation </h1>

<p> As more than 50 million children returned to in-person learning this summer and fall – many of whom stepped into classrooms for the first time in 18 months – educators, school leaders and parents braced for the impact of students' social and emotional learning loss and the uptick in anxiety, depression and other mental health crises both caused and exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>But Joe Erardi, who took over as superintendent of schools in Newtown, Conn., in the wake of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School that left 20 children and 6 staff members dead, knew that the back-to-school season would be difficult and dangerous like never before. </p>
<p>"If we had this conversation in July and the question was asked, 'What do we think is going to happen at the start of this school year,' I would have been absolutely emphatic with my response to that question that this will be the most violent, most upsetting, most horrible start to public schools across the country," said Erardi, who is now a school safety consultant for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. "And so sadly I'm right." </p>
<p>Between August 1 and September 15, there have been 30 instances of gunfire on school grounds, killing five and wounding 23, according to Everytown for Gun Safety – the highest count and most number of people shot during that back-to-school period since the organization began tracking gunfire on school grounds in 2013. </p>
<p> Another school shooting was added to that list Wednesday morning, when an 18-year-old student at Timberview High School in Arlington, Texas shot and injured three people after an altercation with another classmate escalated.</p>
<p>There were four reported injuries, a 15 year old boy remains in critical condition, while a teacher is in good condition, a third victim was grazed by a bullet and was released from the hospital and a fourth injury resulted from a fall, but that person was treated on the scene. </p>
<p>"When you are aware that there are over 5 million children in the U.S. who live in a home with an unsecured firearm, that's a formula for a horrible thing," he said Thursday on a press call planned prior to the school shooting in Texas that brought together gun safety advocates, educators and researchers to call on Congress – yet again – to pass firearms legislation. </p>
<p> "You parlay that with the anxiety and stress that preK through 12 children have lived through for the last 18 months," Erardi said. "If you allow this country's most complex minds to stay home and plan for 18 months, it is a formula for a horrible school opening. And that's exactly what's taken place."</p>
<p> Erardi was joined by Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, Randi Weingartner, president of the American Federation of Teachers and more.</p>
<p>Their calls for background checks, secure firearms storage, age requirements for purchasing, extreme risk protection orders and more are hardly new. They're demands that have been made for more than a decade and come at a time when Congress is legislatively overburdened with raising the debt ceiling and negotiating a path forward for the president's infrastructure and family proposals. </p>
<p>Watts said the coalition is mounting a new effort to pressure the Biden administration to prioritize the gun safety legislation passed by the House in June, but has yet to move in the Senate, where moderates, like Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, have opposed the legislation. </p>
<p>"We're coming together today after yet another school shooting tragedy," said Watts. "It has been a long pandemic and it's still going on. I know families all across the country were eager to get kids back into the classrooms this fall. Sadly, back to school has meant back to school shootings for too many communities across the country." </p>
<p>"There have been school shootings in parking lots and in classrooms, during sporting events and homecoming dances, not to mention the dozens of guns that have been found on school grounds without having been fired," she said. </p>
<p> In addition to putting the White House and Congress on alert, the groups implored schools to rethink their use of metal detectors, "traumatic" school shooting drills and policies that arm educators and put police officers in schools – so-called school hardening strategies that they say have adverse effects on learning, especially for students of color.</p>
<p> Earlier this month, the coalition released a joint statement warning about the high risk of gun violence in schools, and urged the Education Department to encourage school districts to send parents information on how to safely store firearms.</p>
<p> "Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, this country was dealing with an epidemic of gun violence," Pringle said. "And as schools returned to in-person learning, the shootings at our schools have continued. Way too often, students are coping with the trauma of gun violence. We are tired of thoughts and prayers." </p>
<p>"That is why we are here demanding action," she said. "The House has done its job by taking action to protect our students and communities with common sense gun violence prevention. It's time that the Senate stop stalling." </p>
